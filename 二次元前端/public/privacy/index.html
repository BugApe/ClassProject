        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                <p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Information you provide us directly:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>User Content (e.g., photos and other materials) that you post through the Service.
                        Communications between you and Selfie2Anime. For example, we may send you Service-related emails
                        (e.g., changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that
                        you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

                <ol>
                    <li>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.
                        These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you
                        visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and
                        use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot
                        reasonably be used to identify any individual User.

                        <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request
                            to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the

                            pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain
                            names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar
                            information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened
                            and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate
                            reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

                            or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device
                            identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in
                            connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device
                            by Selfie2Anime.</p>

                            and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of
