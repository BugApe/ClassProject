        <h2>Description of Services</h2>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Selfie2Anime is a webservice software that uses artificial intelligence algorithms to transform your
                photos or videos into works of art. The artificial intelligence algorithms use styles inspired by
                various artists within the animation industry. The webservice allows you to upload photographs onto the
                application which will then run through Selfie2Anime’s algorithms, transforming the photo. You can then
                share the photos through social media sites or store them for personal use.
